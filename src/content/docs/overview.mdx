Metro UI is a free, open source, html-first toolkit for developing websites with HTML, CSS, and JS. With Metro UI, you can easily and quickly make a site from prototype to production.
Metro UI includes general styles and JavaScript routines, responsive grid, layouts, typography, 100+ components, and 800+ built-in icons.

## Features

+ **Html-First**: Using Metro UI is straightforward. You don't even need to know javascript to make fully functional websites that interact with the user.
+ **JS Routines**: Metro UI includes several JS libraries to work with HTML elements, strings, color, datetime, and others. You can create scheme validators with Guardian.
+ **Dark & Light**: Metro UI supports dark-light switching out of the box, including the relevant components.

## Started from any source

+ **CDN**: You can start using Metro UI right away by including the CDN link in your HTML file. The CDN is provided by the excellent provider [KeyCDN](https://keycdn.com/).
+ **NPM**: You can also install Metro UI [from npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@olton/metroui). This is the recommended way to use Metro UI in your project.
+ **Download**: You can download Metro UI from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/olton/metroui)

## Build with any Bundlers

Use any bundler to create your own set of Metro UI components: **esbuild**, **Webpack**, **Parcel**, **Rollup**, **Vite**, or any other.

## Metro UI Structure

Metro UI offers developer utilities functions, 7 specialized modules, and 100+ components, that don't require jQuery.
Moreover, Metro UI contains the `Dom` module, which provides the user with most of `jQuery's` functionality for interacting with the DOM.
There are also modules for working with `dates`, `strings`, and `color`.

You can create scheme validators with `Guardian`, or use `Hooks` to create your own hooks: `useDebounce`, `useThrottle`, `useEvent`, `useEffect`.

All parts are written by the same author, so Metro UI has `zero-dependency`.

## Metro UI Icons

Metro Icons is an open source SVG icon library featuring over 800+ glyphs. Use them as SVGs or icon fontsâ€”both options give you vector scaling and easy customization via CSS. You can include icons in your project either using a CDN or using your favorite bundler.
