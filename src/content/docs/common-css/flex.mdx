This component provides a comprehensive set of utility classes for creating flexible layouts using CSS Flexbox in Metro UI.

## Overview

The `flex` component defines a wide range of CSS classes that implement all aspects of the Flexbox layout model. These utilities make it easy to create responsive, flexible layouts without writing custom CSS.

## Display Classes

These classes set the display property to create flex containers:

| Class | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `.d-flex` | Creates a block-level flex container |
| `.d-inline-flex` | Creates an inline-level flex container |

## Flex Container Properties

| Class | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `.flex-row` | Items are placed in a row (default) |
| `.flex-row-reverse` | Items are placed in a row in reverse order |
| `.flex-column` | Items are placed in a column |
| `.flex-column-reverse` | Items are placed in a column in reverse order |

### Flex Wrap

Controls whether flex items wrap onto multiple lines:

| Class | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `.flex-nowrap` | Items will not wrap (default) |
| `.flex-wrap` | Items will wrap onto multiple lines if needed |

| `.flex-align-content-stretch` | Lines stretch to fill the container (default) |

## Flex Item Properties

### Order

## Responsive Variants

All of the above classes have responsive variants that apply at specific breakpoints. The responsive variants follow the naming pattern `.{class}-{breakpoint}`.

For example:
- `.d-flex-md` - Creates a flex container on medium screens and above
- `.flex-column-lg` - Applies column direction on large screens and above
- `.flex-justify-center-xl` - Centers items on extra-large screens and above

Where `{breakpoint}` can be: `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `xxl`, `xxxl`

## Usage Examples

### Basic Flex Container

```html
<div class="d-flex">
    <div>Item 1</div>
    <div>Item 2</div>
    <div>Item 3</div>
</div>
```

### Responsive Direction

```html
<!-- Row on small screens, column on medium screens and above -->
<div class="d-flex flex-row flex-column-md">
    <div>Item 1</div>
    <div>Item 2</div>
    <div>Item 3</div>
</div>
```

### Alignment and Justification

```html
<!-- Center items both horizontally and vertically -->
<div class="d-flex flex-center" style="height: 200px;">
    <div>Centered Content</div>
</div>

<!-- Distribute items evenly with space between -->
<div class="d-flex flex-justify-between">
    <div>Left</div>
    <div>Middle</div>
    <div>Right</div>
</div>
```

### Item Ordering

```html
<div class="d-flex">
    <div class="order-3">Appears third</div>
    <div class="order-1">Appears first</div>
    <div class="order-2">Appears second</div>
</div>
```

### Equal Width Items

```html
<div class="d-flex flex-equal-items">
    <div>Equal</div>
    <div>Equal</div>
    <div>Equal</div>
</div>
```

### Pushing Items

```html
<div class="d-flex">
    <div>Left</div>
    <div class="flex-right">Right</div>
</div>
```

### Responsive Layouts

```html
<div class="d-flex flex-column flex-row-lg">
    <div class="order-2 order-1-lg">First on large screens, second on small screens</div>
    <div class="order-1 order-2-lg">Second on large screens, first on small screens</div>
</div>
```

## Best Practices

1. Start with the basic container class (`.d-flex` or `.d-inline-flex`) before adding other flex utilities.
2. Use responsive variants to create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.
3. For complex layouts, combine flex utilities with other Metro UI classes like spacing and sizing utilities.
4. Use `.flex-center` for the common pattern of centering content both horizontally and vertically.
5. Use `.flex-equal-items` when you want all items to have equal width regardless of their content.
6. Use the positioning shortcuts (`.flex-right`, `.flex-left`, etc.) to push items to different sides of the container.
