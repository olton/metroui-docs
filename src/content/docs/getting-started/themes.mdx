## About

Metro UI supports out-of-the-box `light` and `dark` themes for components. 
By default, the theme is set to `light`. To change the theme, add class `.dark-side` to the `<html>` tag for global or set this class to the `<element>` for local.

```html
<!-- Global -->
<html class="dark-side">
```

```html
<!-- Local -->
<div class="dark-side">
    <div data-role="calendar"></div>
</div>
```

## Theme according to the system

You can use the `prefers-color-scheme` media feature to detect if the user has requested the system use a `light` or `dark` color theme.
To use this feature, add meta tag `metroui:theme` with content `auto` to the page `<head>`. Also, you can use values `light` and `dark` to set the specific theme.

```html
<meta name="metroui:theme" content="auto">
```

## Theme switcher

Metro UI has a built-in theme switcher that allows you to switch between `light` and `dark` themes.
You can use component `theme-switcher` to add control to switch between light and dark themes. 
This component automatically sets theme class `.dark-side` to the specified target element (by default, it is `<html>` element). 
To use this component, add attribute `data-role="theme-switcher"` to the `<input>` element.

### Switcher modes

You can use the `data-mode` attribute to set the theme switcher mode.

#### Switch

```html
<input type="checkbox" data-role="theme-switcher">
```

#### Button

```html
<input type="checkbox" data-role="theme-switcher" data-mode="button">
```


:::caution[Warning!]
The component `theme-switcher` will not work if meta-tag is used!
