## Rules

| BREAKPOINT | RULE      | SIZE PX |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| fs         | min-width | 0       |
| sx         | min-width | 360     |
| sm         | min-width | 576     |
| ld         | min-width | 640     |
| md         | min-width | 768     |
| lg         | min-width | 992     |
| xl         | min-width | 1200    |
| xxl        | min-width | 1400    |
| xxxl       | min-width | 2000    |

## Elements with container definition
The rules work for elements that are in blocks that have a container definition.
Metro UI has a set of classes that define the container for the element:

+ `.container` - container for the content with a fixed width
+ `.container-fluid` - full-width container
+ `.container-query` - simple container
+ `.row` - row for the grid system

## Usage

:::tip[Important]
For these rules to work, the element must be in a block that has a container definition!
:::

<Steps>
    1. You can use media rules to create responsive layouts with a grid system.
    2. You can use media rules in components with attribute `data-expand-point="*"`.
    3. With utility functions `Metro.utils.mediaExist()` and `Metro.utils.inMedia()`.
    4. With common CSS (spacing, displaying, ...) classes.
</Steps>

```html
<div class="row">
    <div class="cell-sx-6 .cell-sm-4 .cell-md-3 .cell-lg-2 .cell-xl-1">
        ...
    </div>
</div>
```
