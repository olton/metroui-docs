<Leader content="Learn about the browsers and devices, from modern to old, that are supported by Metro UI, including known quirks and bugs for each!"/>

## Supported browsers

Metro UI supports the latest, stable releases of all major browsers and platforms.

Alternative browsers which use the latest version of WebKit, Blink, or Gecko, whether directly or via the platform’s web view API, are not explicitly supported. 
However, Metro UI should (in most cases) display and function correctly in these browsers as well. More specific support information is provided below.

```
// package.json
"browserslist": ["last 2 versions"]
```

We use [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) to handle intended browser support via CSS prefixes, which uses [Browserslist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist) to manage these browser versions. 

## Mobile devices

Generally speaking, Metro UI supports the latest versions of each major platform’s default browsers. 
Note that proxy browsers (such as Opera Mini, Opera Mobile’s Turbo mode, UC Browser Mini, Amazon Silk) aren't supported.

## Desktop browsers

Similarly, the latest versions of most desktop browsers are supported.
