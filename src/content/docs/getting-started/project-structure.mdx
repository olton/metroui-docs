title: Project Structure
---

The project follows a specific structure to ensure consistency in the development and maintenance process.
Source code is located in the `source` folder, and compiled code is in the `lib` folder.

## Source Code Structure

The source code is divided into modules, which are located in folders inside the `source` folder:
- `colors-css` — modules that implement colors
- `common-css` — modules that implement common styles
- `common-js` — modules that implement common functions
- `components` — modules that implement components
- `core` — modules that implement the core of the library
- `datetime` — module that implements components for working with date and time
- `dom` — module that implements components for working with DOM
- `extensions` — modules that implement extensions of standard JavaScript objects
- `farbe` — module that implements color functionality
- `guardian` — module that implements data validation functions
- `hooks` — modules that implement hooks (`useMemo`, `useState`, `useEffect`, etc.)
- `html` — modules that implement functions for creating HTML elements in JavaScript
- `i18n` — modules that implement functions for working with localization
- `icons` — modules that implement functions for working with icons
- `include` — LESS modules that implement style variables and mixins
- `model` — module that implements functions for working with reactive data model
- `reset` — module that implements style resets
- `router` — module that implements functions for working with routing for SPA
- `string` — module that implements functions for working with strings

Individual files in the `source` folder:
- `index.js` — entry point for bundlers, includes all components and styles in the build
- `i18n.js` — entry point for bundlers, includes all localizations
- `icons.js` — entry point for bundlers, includes all icons
- `runtime.js` — entry point for bundlers, includes in the build all functions that are not components and styles
- `default.js` — entry point for bundlers, includes in the build `reset`, `common{css,js}`, `i18n`, `runtime`, and all `component`

### Components
Each component has its own folder, which contains files `index.js`, `[component-name].less`, `[component-name].js`.
Also, in the component folder, there may be additional component inclusions that are used by the current component.

### Color Styles
Color styles are located in the `colors-css` folder. Each file represents a separate module with classes that implement one specific behavior.

### Common Styles
Common styles are located in the `common-css` folder. Each file represents a separate module with classes that implement one specific behavior.

### Common Functions
Common functions are located in the `common-js` folder. The file contains various functions that are not components or styles, but are used in different components.

### External Modules
In folders: `dom`, `html`, `datetime`, `farbe`, `guardian`, `hooks`, `model`, `router`, and `string` are functions that connect third-party modules for use with Metro UI.

### Library Core
In the `core` folder are modules that implement the core of the library and the global namespace `Metro`.
