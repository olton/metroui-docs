## Available CSS Classes

## Additional Notes

The typer component can be used within any HTML element, not just span elements. For example, you can use it within heading elements for more prominent display:

```html
<h1>
    <span>Welcome to</span>
    <span data-role="typer" data-colors="#ed426d,#6d67c6,#b74033">Metro UI, Impressive Components Library, First in Metro Style</span>
</h1>
```

## Best Practices

- Use short, impactful phrases for better visual effect
- Consider using custom colors to match your website's theme
- Adjust typing speed and delays based on the content length and desired effect
- For longer text segments, consider using a larger delay to give users time to read
