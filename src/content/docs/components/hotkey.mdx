The Hotkey component provides functionality for handling keyboard shortcuts (hotkeys) in your Metro UI application. It allows you to bind specific key combinations to elements or functions, making your application more accessible and user-friendly.

## Type of Hotkeys
The component supports two types of hotkeys:
1. Simple hotkeys - `ctrl+s`, `alt+f`, `alt+shift+i`
2. Combined hotkeys - `alt+1 2`, `ctrl+shift+f 3`

## Usage

You can use the Hotkey component to: 

+ Bind hotkeys to inputs, textareas, or contenteditable elements
+ Bind hotkeys to buttons, links, or any other elements
+ Directly register hotkey in global Metro hotkeys registry

The component listens for key events and triggers the associated actions when the defined hotkeys are pressed.

### Editable Elements
To bind hotkey to editable elements (like inputs or textareas), you must use the `hotkey` method on the element itself. For example:

```javascript
$("#myInput").hotkey("ctrl+s", function(e, pressedKey, definedKey) {
    console.log("Hotkey pressed:", pressedKey);
    e.preventDefault(); // Prevent default browser behavior if needed
});
```

### Non-Editable Elements
For non-editable elements (like buttons or links), you can use the `data-hotkey` attribute to define the hotkey directly in the HTML. 
The component will automatically bind the hotkey to the element.

```html
<button data-hotkey="ctrl+s" onclick="alert('Hello!')">Save</button>
```

Alternatively, you can use the `hotkey` method in JavaScript to bind the hotkey to the element.

```javascript
$("#myButton").hotkey("ctrl+s");
```

### Global Hotkeys

```javascript
// Define a global hotkey
Metro.hotkeys["ctrl+g"] = ["#globalAction", function() {
    console.log("Global hotkey Ctrl+G was triggered");
}];
```

### Special Keys
The component supports various special keys including:
- Navigation: `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`, `home`, `end`, `pageup`, `pagedown`
- Function keys: `f1-f12`
- Control keys: `backspace`, `tab`, `return/enter`, `shift`, `ctrl`, `alt`, `esc`, `space`, `insert`, `del`
- Others: `capslock`, `numlock`, `scroll`, `meta`

### Combining Hotkeys

You can combine multiple keys using the ` ` (space) symbol. For example:

```html
<button data-hotkey="alt+1 2">Button</button>
```

In the example above, pressing `Alt+1` will trigger the hotkey, and then pressing `2` will execute the action associated with the button.

## API Methods

### hotkey(key, callback)

Binds a keyboard shortcut to an element.

**Parameters:**
- `key` (String): The key combination to bind (e.g., "ctrl+s", "alt+shift+f")
- `callback` (Function, optional): The function to execute when the hotkey is triggered

**Parameters passed to callback:**
- `event`: The original keyboard event
- `pressedKey`: The actual key combination that was pressed
- `definedKey`: The key combination that was defined in the binding



## Repeat Prevention
By default, the component prevents repeated triggering when a key is held down. For global hotkeys, you can enable repeat by adding the `data-repeat` attribute to the target element.

:::note
When binding hotkeys to anchor (`<a>`) elements:
- If the anchor has an href attribute, clicking the hotkey will navigate to that URL
- If no callback is provided, the default behavior is to follow the href or trigger a click
