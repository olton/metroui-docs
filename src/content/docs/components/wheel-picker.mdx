The WheelPicker component provides a wheel-based selection mechanism that allows users to scroll through a list of options. It is primarily used as a dependency for other components like DatePicker and TimePicker.

## Usage

The WheelPicker is typically not used directly but is integrated into other components. However, it can be styled using CSS variables.

## CSS Variables

The WheelPicker component can be styled using the following CSS variables:

| Variable | Default (Light) | Dark Mode | Description |
| -------- | --------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| --wheel-picker-border-radius | 4px | 4px | Border radius for the wheel picker |
| --wheel-picker-color | #191919 | #dbdfe7 | Text color for the wheel picker options |
| --wheel-picker-selected-background | rgba(175, 175, 175, 0.5) | rgba(78, 81, 88, 0.5) | Background color for the selected option |

## Styling with CSS

You can customize the appearance of the WheelPicker by overriding the CSS variables:

```css
:root {
  --wheel-picker-border-radius: 6px;
  --wheel-picker-color: #333;
  --wheel-picker-selected-background: rgba(0, 123, 255, 0.3);
}
```
